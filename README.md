#### Introduction ####

Drop in an MP3 and see it's frequencies visualized using the ubiquitous FFT and beautiful real-time fluid dynamics.

It takes inspiration from the [Loop Music Visualizer](http://airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/reactive/) by [Felix Turner](https://twitter.com/felixturner).

It utilizes the algorithim created by Jos Stam ([Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://www.autodeskresearch.com/pdf/GDC03.pdf)), monochrome dynamics implemented by Oliver Hunt ([Oliver's simple fluid dynamics simulator](http://nerget.com/fluidSim/)), amended with RJ Marsan's RGB example ([Plasma Pong Android by RJ Marsan](https://github.com/rjmarsan/PlasmaPongAndroid)) and a little special sauce by yours truly.

#### Beta Disclaimer ####

If you are viewing this code - don't judge me too harshly :D.

Still needs a good clean up and encapsulation - just aimed to get it working as quickly as I could.
